# Replicate and Extend the paper "Does Cram School matter? Who goes to Cram School? Evidence from Taiwan"

Cram school is a unique cultural phenomenon in Asia which has appeared out of a growing competition about spots in good schools. Students attend cram school in their free time to either study ahead or catch up with classes. Liu (2012) studied the effect of cram school in Taiwan and the question of who go to cram school in his paper "Does Cram School matter? Who goes to Cram School? Evidence from Taiwan".  In this project, I confirmed most of professor Liu’s findings through my own replications, extended the investigation by testing the effect of cram school more rigorously through matching and furthered the discussion of who (whose children) goes to cram school by looking at the interactions between parents’ education and economic status.
